# Satellite Connectivity & Robustness

How a voice satellite (Pi Zero 2 W + ReSpeaker) connects to Renfield, the failure
modes that make it flaky, and the robustness knobs that let a blip self-heal
instead of wedging.

## Connection path

```
satellite (renfield_satellite)
  └─ single persistent WebSocket → wss://renfield.local/ws/satellite
        │  (k8s ingress renfield-https: /ws → backend:8000; self-signed cert, verify_tls=false)
        ▼
backend  ha_glue/api/websocket/satellite_handler.py  (/ws/satellite)
  • first message is `register` (id + room + capabilities) → `register_ack`
  • then: app heartbeat every 30s + WS ping/pong keepalive
  • SatelliteManager tracks live connections IN MEMORY (lost on a backend restart)
```

There is no pre-registration: any satellite may connect and is registered fresh
each time; the room row is created on first connect (`ROOMS_AUTO_CREATE_FROM_SATELLITE`).

## Failure modes (why it gets flaky)

1. **Weak 2.4 GHz WiFi.** The Pi Zero 2 W is single-band 2.4 GHz with a marginal
   antenna. Measured LAN RTT to a live satellite: 31–475 ms, ~220 ms jitter. Lossy
   links drop the WS; slow links make every handshake fragile. **This is the
   dominant cause** — fix it at the network layer (closer AP / mesh node / clean
   2.4 GHz channel; or a USB-OTG Ethernet adapter for a stationary unit).
2. **mDNS / boot-window race.** `renfield.local` depends on Avahi + the cluster
   `mdns-responder`. At boot (before NTP/mDNS are ready) the handshake can time
   out — these failures appear only in the *satellite* journal, never in backend
   logs (they never reach FastAPI). Concretely, the first 1–2
   `getaddrinfo("renfield.local")` calls fail with `[Errno -2] Name or service
   not known` for ~2-3s until Avahi's multicast cache warms, then resolve fine.
   The reconnect loop recovers from this (≥ v1.4.1) — see *In-process wedges*
   below for the strand bug where it didn't.
3. **Device offline.** A powered-off / crashed / WiFi-disassociated Pi shows
   nothing in backend logs. Check it physically: `ping <ip>`, ARP, the LED. A
   4-mic-HAT unit can hit the AC108 + onnxruntime same-process kernel crash —
   mitigate with `use_arecord: true`.
4. **In-process wedges (fixed in the client).** See below.

## Bluetooth presence scanning won't work

Symptom: `PRESENCE_ENABLED=true`, a device registered (`user_ble_devices`), the
satellite logs `BLE/Classic BT scan loop started` and `… known devices received`
— yet nobody is ever placed in the room.

- **Adapter rfkill-blocked (the silent killer).** A Pi can boot with Bluetooth
  **rfkill soft-blocked** (`hci0 DOWN`); the scan loops run but every probe fails
  (`Operation not possible due to RF-kill`). Check on the Pi: `rfkill list
  bluetooth` (Soft blocked: yes), `hciconfig hci0` (DOWN). Fixed by the
  `renfield-bt.service` oneshot (provisioned via `--tags bluetooth`) which
  `rfkill unblock bluetooth` + `hciconfig hci0 up` on every boot.
- **Phones don't answer unpaired Classic-BT probes.** Even with the adapter up,
  a modern phone (iPhone/Samsung/Android) only responds to `hcitool name` /
  `l2ping` when it is **discoverable** or **bonded (paired)** with that adapter —
  in normal use it reports `Host is down`. So a registered `detection_method=
  classic_bt` phone stays invisible until paired per-satellite, or until phone
  presence is sourced from elsewhere (e.g. Home Assistant device_tracker).
- **Classic-BT room arbitration needs real RSSI.** A `name` probe is binary, so
  every satellite seeing the phone reported a constant synthetic `-50` → two
  satellites tied → the room flip-flopped. The satellite now reads a real RSSI
  via a short-lived ACL connection (`hcitool cc/rssi/dc` through passwordless
  `sudo`, since the service runs as unprivileged `evdb`), **throttled** to once
  per `ble.classic_rssi_interval` (default 300 s) — connecting every scan makes
  the phone stop answering `name` (presence drops to "absent"). Failed reads
  fall back to synthetic `-50`. Toggle with `ble.classic_rssi`.

## Robustness knobs (`server.*` in `satellite.yaml`)

Tuned defaults live in `provisioning/group_vars/satellites.yml`; override per-host
in `host_vars/`.

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ping_interval` | `15` | WS keepalive cadence (s) — tighter than the old hardcoded 20 → faster dead-link detection |
| `ping_timeout` | `8` | drop the link if no pong within (s) |
| `register_timeout` | `15` | **caps the post-connect `register` handshake.** Without it a slow/hung backend blocked the connect coroutine forever, wedging the satellite in CONNECTING with no reconnect |
| `max_disconnected_seconds` | `300` | if the satellite can't reconnect for this long, it **exits cleanly so systemd restarts a fresh process** (backstop for any in-process wedge). `0` disables |
| `reconnect_interval` | `5` | base for the exponential reconnect backoff (5→10→20→40→60 cap) |
| `heartbeat_interval` | `30` | app heartbeat cadence |

Client behavior fixes (shipped in the satellite package):
- `_register()` recv is bounded by `register_timeout` (was unbounded).
- A failed **heartbeat send now triggers reconnect immediately** (was swallowed,
  leaving a zombie connection until the WS ping timeout ~30 s later).
- **Boot-time reconnect strand (≥ v1.4.1).** When the *first* connect failed at
  boot (the cold-mDNS race above), the recovery loop was scheduled with a bare
  `asyncio.create_task()` whose result was discarded; the event loop holds only
  a weak reference, so it was garbage-collected before it ran. "will retry"
  printed but the loop never executed (no `Reconnecting in Xs` line in the
  journal) — the satellite was stranded in `idle` forever, while still showing
  the blue idle LED (so it *looked* connected). Fixed by keeping a strong
  reference (`_reconnect_task`) + the `_reconnecting` guard, and by making each
  reconnect attempt exception-safe so a transient error can't kill the loop or
  bypass the watchdog.
- The disconnect watchdog (`max_disconnected_seconds`) exits → systemd
  `Restart=always` brings up a clean process. `StartLimitIntervalSec=0` in the
  unit ensures these legitimate restarts never trip systemd's burst limit.

> The watchdog uses a **clean `os._exit`**, never a SIGKILL-mid-restart — so it
> does not risk the SD-card corruption that bricked a satellite before.

### Watchdogs beyond the app-level disconnect exit

The `max_disconnected_seconds` watchdog only fires while the **process is still
running**, so it can't recover a *total* hang where the board goes unreachable
for minutes. Two lower layers cover that (both under the `watchdog` tag):

**1. SoC hardware watchdog — kernel / PID-1 hangs.** systemd opens
`/dev/watchdog` and pets it every cycle; if PID 1 or the kernel wedges, the SoC
watchdog hard-resets the board. Raspberry Pi OS **already ships this enabled at
1 min** (`/usr/lib/systemd/system.conf.d/40-rpi-enable-watchdog.conf`), so a bare
edit to `/etc/systemd/system.conf` is **inert** — that OS drop-in outranks it.
We instead write a **higher-precedence drop-in**
`/etc/systemd/system.conf.d/50-renfield-watchdog.conf` with
`RuntimeWatchdogSec={{ satellite_hw_watchdog_sec }}s` (default **14 s**). Keep it
**≤ the SoC max** (BCM2835 ~15 s, sunxi/Allwinner ~16 s) or the timer won't arm.
A `reexec systemd` handler re-arms it live (verified: `RuntimeWatchdogUSec`
drops to 14 s without a reboot — `daemon-reload` alone does **not** re-arm it).

**2. Network watchdog — wedged Wi-Fi / IP stack.** The HW watchdog can *not*
catch the most common drop-off: the kernel stays healthy (so it keeps petting
`/dev/watchdog`) but Wi-Fi/IP is dead and the satellite can't reach the backend.
`renfield-net-watchdog.timer` runs `renfield-net-watchdog.sh` every ~60 s; if the
Pi can't reach its **default gateway** for `net_watchdog_fail_threshold`
consecutive checks (default **5** ≈ 5 min) it `systemctl reboot`s. It keys on the
*gateway*, not the backend, so a backend redeploy never triggers a reboot; a
**10-min post-boot grace** (read from `/proc/uptime`) prevents reboot loops.
Disable with `net_watchdog_enabled: false`.

## Diagnosing "X won't connect"

```bash
# 1. Does the backend ever see it? (zero events ⇒ it never reached FastAPI)
kubectl -n renfield logs deploy/backend --since=24h | grep -i "sat-<room>\|📡\|👋"
# 2. Is the device even on the network? (read-only, safe)
ping <satellite-ip>;  arp -n <satellite-ip>
# 3. The device's own view (read-only):
ssh <pi> journalctl -u renfield-satellite -n 200 --no-pager
#    grep: "Connecting to", "Registered successfully", "Reconnecting in",
#          "timed out during opening handshake", "register ack not received"
```

## Deploying changes safely

Satellite **code/config** changes deploy with Ansible **`--tags app`** (avoids the
driver/service restart that risks bricking the SD card):

```bash
cd src/satellite/provisioning
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml provision.yml --limit satellite-<room> --tags app
```

⚠️ Never blindly remote-restart a satellite service; a SIGKILL mid-restart can
corrupt the Pi Zero 2 W SD card. Roll out one host at a time and verify it
re-registers (backend log `📡 Satellite sat-<room> registered`) before the next.
