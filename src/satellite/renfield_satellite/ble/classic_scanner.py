Classic Bluetooth Scanner for Renfield Satellite

Uses `hcitool name <MAC>` to detect Classic BT (BR/EDR) devices.
Apple devices (iPhone, Apple Watch) have permanent Classic BT MACs
that don't rotate like BLE addresses. This is the technique used by
the well-known 'monitor' project.

Key differences from BLE scanning:
- Presence is binary: a name response means "present". The remote-name
  request works even on non-discoverable devices, which is why it is
  preferred over an inquiry scan.
- Sequential scanning (one device at a time, BT Classic limitation)
- Slower: 1-5 seconds per device
- But: works with Apple devices that randomize BLE MACs

RSSI:
A plain name request carries no signal strength. To let the backend
arbitrate which room a device is in (strongest signal wins), we read a
real RSSI for each present device via a short-lived ACL connection
(`hcitool cc` -> `hcitool rssi` -> `hcitool dc`). This is best-effort:

- The value is the Bluetooth "golden receive power range" RSSI — a
  signed dB offset relative to the ideal range, NOT absolute dBm. It is
  frequently 0 when the link sits inside the golden range, so two
  satellites at similar distance can still tie.
- Some phones (notably iPhones) reject unsolicited ACL connections, so
  `cc` fails and no RSSI is available.

In every failure case we fall back to SYNTHETIC_RSSI so presence
detection is never lost — we only ever *gain* arbitration signal when
the device cooperates. Set `read_rssi=False` (config `ble.classic_rssi`)
to skip the connection attempt entirely and always report the synthetic
value.
